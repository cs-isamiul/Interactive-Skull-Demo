# Interactive-Skull-Demo

This is a work in progress. The goal is to create an interactive demo for students to look at various objects (such as a skull) in 3D space in the browser. Students should be able to look at the object, rotate it and get information from the simulation. This would serve as a supplement to other class resources.
